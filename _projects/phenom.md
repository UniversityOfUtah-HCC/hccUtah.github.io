Personal data is everywhere. People’s increasing use of internet services along with the meteoric adoption of smartphones produces an amazing amount of digital information about individuals. Today, developers can access personal data on social interactions (e.g. email, SMS, Skype, Facebook), planning and coordination (e.g. calendars, TripIt, Basecamp, online to-do lists), entertainment (e.g. YouTube, iTunes, Netflix), and commerce (e.g. banking, Amazon, Zappos, eBay), generating a rich profile that provides insights about individuals. 

This data holds promise for a breadth of new service opportunities that improve people’s lives through deep personalization, tools to manage personal wellbeing, and services that support identity construction. However, to deliver on this promise, developers encounter many challenges due to the fragmented state of personal data today and users’ interests are scattered across a constellation of applications and services. This paper evaluates the landscape of personal data today, including stakeholders, and the process required for incorporating personal data in an application. Next, it combines this practical view with a synthesis of past research to identify key challenges in the current ecosystem of personal data. Finally, it contributes Phenom, an experimental system that we designed and implemented to address those key challenges of working with personal data.
